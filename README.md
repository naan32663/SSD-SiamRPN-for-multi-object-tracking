# SSD-SiamRPN-for-multi-object-tracking

This repository implement for my Master degree of Computer and Information Sciences (MCIS)

The project: (1) Implement the proposed model for object recognition, classification, and tracking for multiple types of anomalies. (2)  Achieve multi-target tracking by combining our object detection algorithm and single-target tracking algorithm. (3) The proposed model is a novel type of deep neural networks to achieve anomaly detection, which has not been found in previous work.
