# SSD-SiamRPN-for-multi-object-tracking

This repository implement for my Master degree of Computer and Information Sciences (MCIS)

The project: (1) Implement the proposed model for object recognition, classification, and tracking for multiple types of objects. (2)  Achieve multi-target tracking by combining our object detection algorithm and single-target tracking algorithm. 

Dependencies: 
Python 3.7, pytorch 1.4, CUDA 10.0
